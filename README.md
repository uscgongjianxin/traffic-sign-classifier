# traffic-sign-classifier

Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

**CarND Starter Kit**

Install the car nanodegree starter kit if you have not already done so: [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)

**TensorFlow**
If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for installing [TensorFlow with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/#optional_install_cuda_gpus_on_linux)

**Amazon Web Services**
* Launch an Instance: Visit the EC2 Management [Console](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#Home:), click "Launch Instance", choose "Community AMIs", search for the “udacity-carnd” AMI and click "select".
* Select the Instance type: Filter the instance list to only show “GPU instances”, select the *g2.2xlarge* instance type. Finally, click on the “Review and Launch” button:
